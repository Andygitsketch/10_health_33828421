# Outline
My project is an calculator for body frame size, a calculation similar to BMI (body mass index) that is done using wrist and height measurements.
# Architechture
For the application tier of the project, I used express.js for the routing code and ejs as the templating engine that made the web application able to change based on user input. The data tier of the web application used MySQL terminal and MySQL workbench

# Data Model
For the data model, I used 2 tables, measurements and users,which are in the create_db.sql file. the results of the calculation are contained within the measurements table.

# User Functionality
the user functionality is made up of 2 input fields for the height and weight values and a button for the calculation. the user inputs the 2 values into the 2 input fields and clicks the calculate button. when the button is clicked on, it will display both values along with the result.
